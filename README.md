**Python Data science [ Fintech Payments ]**

**Introduction**
In the ever-evolving landscape of payment solutions in fintech firms, it is crucial to analyze approval and declined payments to gain valuable insights. Understanding the key merchant accounts and the factors affecting approval rates is of utmost importance for optimizing payment processes and minimizing fraud risks.

**ProjectObjective**: This project focuses on analyzing payment solutions data to identify patterns and trends related to approval and declined payments. By exploring the data and calculating approval rates, decline rates, and other relevant metrics, we aim to gain insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the payment system. These insights can guide decision-making and help improve fraud prevention measures, customer experience, and overall payment performance.

**Data Processing and Analysis**

**1. Importing Libraries**:The required libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, are imported for data manipulation and visualization.
**2. Read the CSV File**The dataset is read from the 'data.csv' file using the pd.read_csv() function and stored in the 'pr' DataFrame.

**3. Data Overview**:The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to provide an initial understanding of the data structure. Missing values in each column are checked to ensure data integrity.

**4. Data Types**:The data types of each column are examined to ensure correct data representation and identify potential inconsistencies.

**5. Summary Statistics**:Summary statistics, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum, are calculated to gain insights into the numerical features.

**6. Data Preparation**:Unnecessary columns are dropped from the DataFrame. New DataFrames are created for specific columns of interest.

**7. Approval Rate Calculation**:The approval rate is calculated based on the response codes, providing an understanding of the percentage of approved transactions.

**8. Approval and Decline Rates**:Average response code is calculated, and approval rate and decline rate are determined as percentages. These metrics help assess the overall performance of the payment system.

**9. Captured Status Visualization**:The count of each captured status is visualized using bar charts, providing a clear understanding of the distribution and trends.

**10. Payment Amount Distribution Visualization**:The distribution of payment amounts is visualized using histograms and box plots. These visualizations help identify any outliers or significant trends in payment amounts across different captured statuses.

**11. Correlation Matrix Visualization**:The correlation matrix is calculated and visualized as a heatmap, enabling the identification of any relationships or dependencies between different features.

**12. Approval and Decline Rates for Different Payment Methods**:The approval and decline rates are calculated for different payment methods. Bar charts are used to visualize these rates, allowing for a comparison of performance across payment methods.

**13. Distribution of Payment Methods**:The distribution of payment methods is visualized using a pie chart, providing insights into the popularity and usage of different payment methods.

**14. Reasons for Declined Payments:**:The reasons for declined payments are analyzed and visualized to understand the common issues leading to declines. By identifying these reasons, appropriate measures can be taken to address and minimize future declines.
By analyzing approval and declined payments in payment solutions data, we aim to gain valuable insights that can drive improvements in fraud prevention, customer experience, and overall payment system performance.
